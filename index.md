<h1 style = "color:#93bd20"> Trevor Croteau's Data Science Portfolio </h1>
This is a place for my journey through learning data science. I will include the code produced for each project of my mine as well as a brief description and the visualizations produced. This page was first published March 23, 2022.

<h3 style = "color:#659e10"> Data </h3>
Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) has done a wonderful job at keeping up-to-date information on the novel Covid-19 pandemic. The github Covid-19 dataset can be found at https://github.com/datasets/covid-19 under an open-source license. It is already cleaned, and so we can begin on analysis steps.

<h1 style = "color:#93bd20"> The Sea Levels Section </h1>
This is a project for a Climate Dashboard website: When published, this will be updated with its link. For now, we have simply demonstrations of what will be on the site.
<h3 style = "color:#659e10"> Changing Sea Level Animations </h3>
Although it is not made clear in the images, they run from 0ft change in sea level to a 10ft change in sea level. This is instead made clear via the website's UI.
